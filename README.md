 You can choose driver or circuit on which you want to race.

 At the beggining you must wait for black lights (game must be started).

 After you can drive in the circuit and try do the best time you can.
 Also I create some sound animations, when car is in move so you can hear different sound when car go to curve.

And after game is over and you are redirect back to inde page.

- Login and register system (when you login so you can keep in your stats and adjusting your car)
