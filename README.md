# F1_game_2D
I used Phaser JS.
## What is Phaser JS ?
Phaser is a 2D game framework used for making HTML5 games for desktop and mobile.[1] It is free software developed by Photon Storm.[2]

Phaser uses both a Canvas and WebGL renderer internally and can automatically swap between them based on browser support. This allows for fast rendering across desktop and mobile.

I love the Formula 1 environment. So I decided create game about it.
